## fonts.html

This page is built to assess Google fonts for logo generation.

To change the font list,

- go to Google Fonts & select a bunch of fonts
- once selected, update `const fontUrl` variable with your font link.
- that should be it! classes & nodes are generated on the fly.

To change colors, look in the header & update the `<style>` block manually.
I recommend `colors.adobe.com` for this.  This will likely be automated as well.
